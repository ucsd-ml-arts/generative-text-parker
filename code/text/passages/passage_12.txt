While ultimately unsuccessful, the Prop-M rover was the first rover to have a form of artificial intelligence.  This A.I. was very limited, and consisted merely of two metal rods on the front of the rover that would allow of autonomous obstacle avoidance.[2]   For the period from the 1970’s until the turn of the century, A.I. in space rovers was no more than simple obstacle avoidance.
