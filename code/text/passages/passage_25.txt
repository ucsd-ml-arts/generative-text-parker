For data collection, rovers are smarter about knowing when to transfer data back to Earth.  While in the past some data has been lost due to poor connection, or not enough storage and being overwritten, the rovers now can decide when they should backup data according to amount of storage left, and broadband connectivity with mission control.[7]  The rovers have also developed the intelligence to think scientifically.
