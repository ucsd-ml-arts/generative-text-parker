The rovers can avoid obstacles and can find better paths to and from ordered positions with greater ease and safety, all with less input needed from the humans back on Earth.  As software is updated, and intelligence is added, the rovers’ capabilities drastically increase.[6]  For data collection, rovers are smarter about knowing when to transfer data back to Earth.
