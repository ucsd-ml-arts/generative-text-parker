Rovers are generally thought of as having cutting-edge technology in order to make scientific discoveries and advancements.  Due to the length of development time and travel time, the building phase lasting over 8 years for NASA’s Curiosity, equipment onboard the rovers is generally robust, but outdated.  While this equipment is something that cannot be easily upgraded once the rover has left Earth, the programming of the rover can be changed, and updated.[4]  Rovers are generally thought of as having cutting-edge technology in order to make scientific discoveries and advancements.
