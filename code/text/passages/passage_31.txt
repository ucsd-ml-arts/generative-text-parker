Increased artificial intelligence for planetary rovers is not without sceptics.  Indeed, there are plenty of obstacles and possible issues that could arise before the A.I. in the rovers can work as desired.  A logistical problem that A.I. faces is the numerous unintended and unforeseen consequences of small errors in the programming, and the sheer amount of time it takes to correct these small errors.
