Since the turn of the century, artificial intelligence has become increasingly present in a wide variety of machines and robotics.  Among experimental robots, Planetary rovers—developed for the most part by organisations such as NASA and the European Space Agency—have been at the cutting edge of A.I. advancements.  The A.I. assists with many aspects of the rovers’ roles, allowing for more efficient basic functions, as well as scientifically thoughtful analysis and scientifically prioritised decisions that can be made autonomously.
