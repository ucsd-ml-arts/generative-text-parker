Among experimental robots, Planetary rovers—developed for the most part by organisations such as NASA and the European Space Agency—have been at the cutting edge of A.I. advancements.  The A.I. assists with many aspects of the rovers’ roles, allowing for more efficient basic functions, as well as scientifically thoughtful analysis and scientifically prioritised decisions that can be made autonomously.  While there are dissenters to the increasing intelligence of rovers, primarily due to a fear of a created thought process, the development of A.I. is continuing to advance and is continuing to be uploaded to rovers on Mars.
