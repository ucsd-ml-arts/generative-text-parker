The lander contained a vehicle on board, called the Prop-M rover.  While ultimately unsuccessful, the Prop-M rover was the first rover to have a form of artificial intelligence.  This A.I. was very limited, and consisted merely of two metal rods on the front of the rover that would allow of autonomous obstacle avoidance.[2]  The lander contained a vehicle on board, called the Prop-M rover.
