Rovers, by nature not needing a human present, are able to travel to and survive on planets and moons not suitable for humans.  Not only do they not need the same accommodations as humans, they also: last much longer than a human would on another planet, can transfer huge amounts of scientific data back to scientists on Earth, and they don’t necessarily need to have a plan to return to Earth.\n",
