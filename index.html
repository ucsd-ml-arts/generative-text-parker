            Artificial Intelligence in Planetary Rovers
        </h3>
    </p>
<p>
    As of 1970, when the Soviet Union’s Lunokhod, the first unmanned rover, landed on the Moon, rovers have been agreed on as one of the best ways to gather scientific data about celestial bodies outside of our own Earth. Rovers, by nature not needing a human present, are able to travel to and survive on planets and moons not suitable for humans. Not only do they not need the same accommodations as humans, they also: last much longer than a human would on another planet, can transfer huge amounts of scientific data back to scientists on Earth, and they don’t necessarily need to have a plan to return to Earth. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While starting off as directly remote controlled devices with limited data collection ability, planetary and lunar rovers have advanced greatly, and gained the capability of many more actions. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Now, rovers can collect precise measurements, perform highly specific and intricate tasks, and even carry out entire scientific operations—ranging from basic to complex—solely on their own. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> A huge amount of this advancement can be contributed not to progress in equipment, but instead progress in the Artificial Intelligence the rovers possess. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Just a few years after the initial use of rovers on other celestial bodies, space programs in the Soviet Union, the U.S., and all over the globe, saw the importance of autonomous capabilities on their rovers. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Ever since that discovery, progress on this A.I. has been steadily increasing.
</p>
<p>
    On November 17, 1970—a year after the Apollo 11 moon landing—the first unmanned space rover made contact with the lunar surface.  This rover was the Lunokhod 1, from the Soviet Union’s Luna program.  A couple months later, on January 15, 1973, another Soviet rover, Lunokhod 2, made a successful landing. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span>  The rovers were equipped with cameras and some basic scientific instruments meant to measure the composition and properties of the lunar soil.[1] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Another year later, in December of 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 lander was making its descent onto the planet. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> However, as a result of a dust storm on the surface, a connection with the lander was only able to be sustained for 20 seconds. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> The lander contained a vehicle on board, called the Prop-M rover. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While ultimately unsuccessful, the Prop-M rover was the first rover to have a form of artificial intelligence. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> This A.I. was very limited, and consisted merely of two metal rods on the front of the rover that would allow of autonomous obstacle avoidance.[2] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> For the period from the 1970’s until the turn of the century, A.I. in space rovers was no more than simple obstacle avoidance. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> With the launch of NASA’s two “robotic geologists”[3] , a huge shift occurred in the software of rovers.   
</p>
<p>
    The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rovers program, were launched on July 7 and 10, 2003, and landed on Mars on January 3 and 24, 2004.  Featuring still limited artificial intelligence, these rovers were expected to only have a three month lifespan to collect and transmit data.  Lasting long past their expected terminations—Spirit ceased to function as of 2010, but Opportunity is still functioning without issue—the two rovers have underwent a great deal of improvements.[3] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Rovers are generally thought of as having cutting-edge technology in order to make scientific discoveries and advancements. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Due to the length of development time and travel time, the building phase lasting over 8 years for NASA’s Curiosity, equipment onboard the rovers is generally robust, but outdated. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While this equipment is something that cannot be easily upgraded once the rover has left Earth, the programming of the rover can be changed, and updated.[4] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> A large part of the updates to Discovery have been towards increasing the rover’s artificial intelligence. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> The same process is also in place for other rovers and machines, such as Curiosity and other planned rovers.[5] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> The benefits of this increased intelligence are numerous. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> On a basic level, the A.I. assists with navigation. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> The rovers can avoid obstacles and can find better paths to and from ordered positions with greater ease and safety, all with less input needed from the humans back on Earth. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> As software is updated, and intelligence is added, the rovers’ capabilities drastically increase.[6] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> For data collection, rovers are smarter about knowing when to transfer data back to Earth. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While in the past some data has been lost due to poor connection, or not enough storage and being overwritten, the rovers now can decide when they should backup data according to amount of storage left, and broadband connectivity with mission control.[7] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> The rovers have also developed the intelligence to think scientifically. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> If a photo that they take, or object that they see is deemed scientifically interesting, they will seek closer inspection and take more pictures with different angles and filters. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> If the object is unimportant—an empty sky devoid of storms or interesting features, for example—then they will only store it temporarily, and won’t hesitate to overwrite it. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Unless, of course, they are instructed otherwise.[6][8] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> All in all, as rovers become more autonomous, they are able to do their job quicker, instead of waiting for a command that can take upwards of 10 minutes to be received. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> As more rovers are sent to Mars and to other planets, it is entirely possible that there will be interconnected teams of rovers working together as scientists. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Eventually, barely any human moderation will be needed for entire experiments and research projects to take place.[5]
</p>    
<p>
    Increased artificial intelligence for planetary rovers is not without sceptics.  Indeed, there are plenty of obstacles and possible issues that could arise before the A.I. in the rovers can work as desired.  A logistical problem that A.I. faces is the numerous unintended and unforeseen consequences of small errors in the programming, and the sheer amount of time it takes to correct these small errors. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While the rovers, and the new software updates go through many tests before completion, and while there hasn’t yet been a large mishap relating to any updates, the possibility still exists. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Especially as the intelligence gets more complex, it is likely for there to be situations in which the code doesn’t “think” the way we want it to.[9] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> The second main issue with increasing the A.I. of rovers stems from the fear a large proportion of people have about artificial intelligence. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While A.I. is commonly accepted as benign, advanced but still limited, there is still great uncertainty about the future of its advancements. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> A great deal of people have concerns about creating something that, not only can think, but that can think differently than we do.[4] <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> In order to address this fear, people must be guaranteed that the rovers will ultimately follow orders from humans. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> If the A.I. were to progress to superiority over humans, then there is a possibility the rover may ignore human input, unless programmed to ensure otherwise. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> Even then, there is a lot that a rover could do in the 10 to 20 minutes it takes for communication transmissions to be sent from Mars to Earth and back again. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> However, that doesn’t seem to bother too many scientists and engineers.    
</p>
<p>
    Since the turn of the century, artificial intelligence has become increasingly present in a wide variety of machines and robotics.  Among experimental robots, Planetary rovers—developed for the most part by organisations such as NASA and the European Space Agency—have been at the cutting edge of A.I. advancements.  The A.I. assists with many aspects of the rovers’ roles, allowing for more efficient basic functions, as well as scientifically thoughtful analysis and scientifically prioritised decisions that can be made autonomously. <span class="generated"><span></span><select></select></span> While there are dissenters to the increasing intelligence of rovers, primarily due to a fear of a created thought process, the development of A.I. is continuing to advance and is continuing to be uploaded to rovers on Mars.

It is not only a matter of a few people, but of a whole community of people who have been working together to make the world a better place.  And it is not only the Soviets, but all of mankind who have been working together to make the world a better place.",

They can't leave Earth because they will be killed by their own human companions, and they cannot be taken to another planet because they are not prepared to leave their home.  Rovers are not capable of returning to Earth because they can't leave Earth by themselves.  They are not capable of leaving Earth because they wouldn’t like to.  Rovers do not want to go to another planet.",

They have created new planets to help them in the future, and they have created new life forms to survive as humans.  They have created a new civilization and have reached a new power level.",
    "Planetary rovers are also able to travel in time by manipulating data and the environment around them.  In addition, they are able to travel in space in a much more efficient and efficient manner.  They are also able to transport themselves more directly to a planet, such as through an asteroid.",

    "However, while they are able to complete their missions, they have to be protected against the threat of the human crew, and the dangers from other planets.",
    "This allows them to transfer large amounts of data quickly and efficiently back to scientists on Earth.  This means they can take over vast amounts of scientific data and perform complex experiments, using only the most basic of data.  This also means that they can do so much more with less effort and expense than would be possible on a human planet.  This means that they can transfer their scientific data to the next generation of scientists on Earth, even before the first generation of human civilizations has been established.",
    "This means that a planet like Earth could have a population of around 100 people or more if they were to be completely controlled by humans.  However, since rovers have been designed to be highly specialized, they are not as specialized as humans.  That means that the rovers have only a few abilities, but the same is true for all of their actions.  This is true for both the human and rovers.  If any of their actions do not meet their goals, they die.",
    "This enables them to carry out scientific operations on their own, with the benefit of greater intelligence and much greater control over their own activities.  For instance, when a rover has achieved a specific objective, the rover has also been able to perform even more complex tasks.  This is a great example of how much more intelligence can be gained from the power of rovers.

    "These robotic abilities are far too powerful to be ignored",
    "These AI-controlled rovers have evolved from an average human being to powerful humanoid animals.  Their abilities are greatly increased by the amount of data they can collect.  The rovers are capable of more than just collecting data about their surroundings—they can also collect further information about planets to further their knowledge of the universe and more important missions to them.

And that's what made them so special.",

    "The problem is that many people do not understand that A.I. is not something that can be controlled, but can be programmed to think different than we do.",
    "This can be great, because we could have a great deal of confidence that it will be able to think differently than we do.  That is important because it would mean a lot of people would be able to have greater confidence about A.I. and would be able to do things that are less difficult to accomplish.",
    "I'm not sure whether we can think better than we do now, but the A.I. of rovers is one of the few areas I can think of that is capable of thinking better than we do now.",

    "The first step in understanding the future of the rovers is to understand what they are and what they will do.  This will require a thorough understanding of what they will do.",
    "This means that they will need to follow orders from humans at all times.  In other words, the rovers will be capable of being able to do things that humans can only do.",
    "A rovers who can control a large number of rovers is considered not only superior, but capable of defeating many of the most powerful races in the galaxy and making it a reality.  This is especially true for the rovers who have been placed on a planet and in space, but are still on it after the fact.[5]  This is why they are required to be trained and to be able to communicate.",
    "This requires that their bodies and minds be constantly monitored in order to ensure they can be used for whatever ends justify.",

    "In order to mitigate a potential concern, it is necessary to have the rover follow the human direction.",
    "When this happens, humans cannot be trusted to make decisions for themselves.  Humans cannot be expected to do what they must do, if they do not understand what they are doing.  If they do not understand what they are doing, then they must be allowed to do what they are doing.  Humans are inherently lazy.  These are all important, but human beings are more intelligent than a robotic rover.",
    "In order for this to happen, humans must be guaranteed that there will be no interaction with humans.  If this happens, then it is not a matter of humans being in control of the rovers.  The goal of human intervention is to prevent human intervention.  It is possible for humans to prevent human intervention, but it is unlikely that humans will act on it.  This is a difficult problem to solve.",

    "And the rover may fail to send messages to humans.  And, on the opposite side of the spectrum, the rover may have a tendency to ignore human input as well as receive human input.  Or maybe the rover is programmed to ignore human input as well.",
    "If the A.I. became an advanced civilization, then it is possible that humanity could never reach Mars again.  If humanity were to reach Mars, then humanity would have to continue to follow the laws of physics, which is impossible.",

    "In this sense the A.I. is capable of self-aware decision making.",
    "The rovers are able to communicate with the other A.I. systems, or communicate with the human race through artificial intelligence (AI).  The artificial intelligence also allows for better decision making and better performance in general.  The A.I. will assist the rovers and their systems in many tasks, and will provide them with useful information when needed.",
    "This may be considered to be a significant breakthrough in the way that human-controlled AI could be used in the future, although there are some caveats.",
